Based in Glasgow, I am a Freelance Yoga Instructor with a genuine love for all aspects of yoga, from physical to philosophical and spiritual. I teach a variety of styles of yoga, including Energising and Slow Vinyasa, Power Yoga and Restorative Yin.

In October 2023, I completed my 200-hour multi-style YTTC training in Goa, India, at the amazing Drishti International Yoga School, with my teachers Manav and Samita. In order to honour the beauty of the ancient practice of Yoga within my classes, I am conscious to intergrate spiritual elements within the physical practice.
