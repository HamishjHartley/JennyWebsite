Embarking on a multi-style YTTC training in India was a hugely insightful experience. The course covered the philosophy and history of yoga, anatomy of the human body, and most importantly, ways in which to confidently teach Hatha and Vinyasa style yoga classes for beginner and intermediate levels. The course was heavily focused on the traditional aspects of yoga, particularly surrounding Sanskrit translation and the philosophy of yoga.
